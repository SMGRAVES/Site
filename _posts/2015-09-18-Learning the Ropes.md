The best advice I can give to anyone starting to learn Jekyll is to find a great theme that you really like and hack away at it with a purpose. Oh, and <em>never</em> edit anything in the [_site folder](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) becasue anyhting you do will be erased and you'll get very, very, very, frustrated until you figure that out!

This theme I'm using is called [<i>Naringu</i>](https://github.com/ariestiyansyah/naringu) and was developed by [Rizky Ariestiyansyah](https://github.com/ariestiyansyah/naringu) , it's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com).
